# qmpo

**Open Directory With Browser** - A cross-platform `directory://` URI scheme
handler that opens directories in your file manager.

[日本語](README-ja.md)

## Overview

qmpo enables you to open directory with browser using a custom URI scheme. When
you click a `directory://` link or enter it in your browser's address bar,
qmpo opens the corresponding directory in your system's file manager.

This tool bridges the gap between web browsers and local file systems, making
it easy to open directory with browser navigation.

## URI Format

| OS | File Path | URI Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows (local) | `C:\Users\tagawa` | `directory://C:/Users/tagawa` |
| Windows (UNC) | `\\server\share\folder` | `directory://server/share/folder` |
| macOS/Linux | `/home/tagawa` | `directory:///home/tagawa` |

**Note:** If a file path is specified, qmpo opens the parent directory
containing that file.
